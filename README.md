### Project Link:- https://ml-carpriceprediction-api.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction:-

This project is based on cars data from [Cars24](https://www.cars24.com/) which is a place for buyers and sellers for cars across India. Do you ever think to sell your car but you are unsure about the prices.? It might me any city or any brand of car. So we have got a solution for you, by using the technique of **Machine Learning** we can predict best price for your Car.

As the title suggests this is an end-to-end project, let me explain how and which are those stages ?

## Lifecycle Of Project:-

### 1:- Collecting Data:-

This involves the process of collecting data from different sources such as any car selling website such as [Cars24](https://www.cars24.com/) , which has records of various cars available. For this I've used Web Scraping i.e I have extracted car's data from the website. Once you write the code you can use it repeatedly after specific intervals for updated data, it makes the the data collection part hassle free. The tools I've used are **Beautiful Soup** & **Selenium**.
